        "description":"The key characteristic of this composition is obviously an immobile black ocean against the background of which colors and forms emerge in isolation. The magnificence of these colored forms leads to reflections about shapes, created by Matisse a decade later. The movement of forms is clearly directed upwards from both sides of the central axis, which crosses the object resembling a book and situating closer to the upper part of the canvas. In general the composition arouses sensation of some external space with soaring objects in it.",

At the time of the painting, the United States took very seriously the threat of Communism and the cold war with Russia. Convergence was the embodiment of free speech and freedom of expression. Pollock threw mud in the face of convention and rebelled against the constraints of society's oppression. It was everything that America stood for all wrapped up in a messy, but deep package. ",

Frankenthaler was celebrated for her ‘soak-stain’ technique with this being the first work created using it. In this technique Frankenthaler thinned down her paint with turpentine or kerosene, and the resulting fluid would be absorbed through her unprimed canvases. This stain would leave an aura that gave her works a sense of perpetual movement. ",

This resulted in him creating a series of more than 200 paintings in response to it.The series Elegy to the Spanish Republic serves as a multiplicity of commemorations of human suffering, as well as abstract, poetic symbols for the inexorable cycle of life and death. About the Elegies, Motherwell stated that, “After a period of painting them, I discovered Black as one of my subjects—and with black, the contrasting white, a sense of life and death which to me is quite Spanish. They are essentially the Spanish black of death contrasted with the dazzle of a Matisse-like sunlight.”",

She awaits the ballet master’s cue to begin. The watering can (used to dampen the rosin on the floor), the top hat used to carry the music, and the empty violin box are all props that Degas continued to utilize in his ballet paintings.

He began his career essentially as a portrait painter but in his later years indulged a growing taste for landscape in oil and charcoal. This drawing represents features of one of three sites in Massachusetts at which Hunt worked in the late 1870s: West Newbury, North Easton, and Magnolia, on Cape Ann. The artist’s preference for bold, coarse charcoal rendering recalls the favored medium and technique of his friend and paragon in France, Jean-Francois Millet, while the composition reflects the screen-like arrangement in the landscapes of Jean Baptist Camille Corot.",

The artist posed the deeply expressive male figure in a relief-like plane, with an elegant contrapposto (the turning of the body and its limbs in counterpoints of form), to create suggestive profile and frontal views that enhance the visual power of the image. The drawing is executed with very dynamic contrasts of finish and unfinish, in which the charcoal is at times seamlessly blended for polished, highly luminous effects, while at other times the bold strokes of the charcoal applied in parallel and cross-hatching are left evident for expressive effects. As a final step, Salviati traced the outlines of the figure with a fine metal point, a quicker way to transfer the design onto the plaster fresco surface, than the technique of pricking and pouncing the outlines with a sharp point.",

The sitter, rendered strangely mute by her helmetlike covering and untouchable by its thorny needles, varies slightly from sheet to sheet. While the exact meaning of Redon's image is unclear, it has been thought that the bizarre bondage imposed on his sitter expresses subconscious fear of female sexuality or, conversely, serves as a symbol of female fecundity. Equally important, however, is Redon's virtuoso handling of charcoal and his ability to capture its full range of tones, from the dark velvet quality of the helmet to the pallor of the woman's skin.",
